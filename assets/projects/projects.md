you can't manage what you can't measure.
Differentiate data vs quality/good data.
Automation: Identify terminated employees' EDM logins by looking up EDM login (email/network id) against Active Directory to term in EDM as well.
EDM files are generated and cleaned up for file generation for data corrections and generate files. The previous set of files and new files submissions resulted in duplicate rejections at the Encounters processing agency. Developed a process to scan for files in a configured directory recursively with matching file name regex and lookup those file names (in some cases we read Interchange Control# from ISA13) against the database table to move invalid files to a different directory and notified users.

According to HIPAA guidelines we are required to send vendor-specific responses to vendors. Developed a custom process to identify vendor files/content by NCPDP D.0 file batch id between vendor inbound and response file from state, or date of service, or by looking up claim id prefixes. 



**States:**  
Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington District of Columbia.  
**Training:**
Trained 15 programmers/developers to use an open-source git source code (version) control system with detailed release strategy documentation.  

**Achievements:**  
$10 million one-time saving by reconciling source claims against Encounters submitted to submit unprocessed and resubmit rejected Encounters with corrected information to meet State defined completeness and accuracy SLAs.  
Reconciliation uncovered a bunch of problems in claims adjudication and Enterprise Data Warehouse systems.  
$70K per year saving by automating manual activities in a legacy home-grown application at the time of reinsurance application migration to the Open Twins application.
40% (~400) of batch jobs were eliminated by redesigning applications. This is a great relief for the Technology Operations team.  
Current state systems assessment and future (to be) state systems recommendations. Get claims, Encounters volume and $ summary.  
Redesign Encounters Data Processing System applications to improve acceptance by 18% in the initial submission. Resubmission cost $360,000 (2 resources * 1800 hours * $100) per year cost savings.  
End-to-end Medicaid/Medicare/Medicare-Medicaid Encounter Data Processing execution in Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington District of Columbia states.  
Trained 15 programmers/developers to use an open-source git source code (version) control system with detailed release strategy documentation.
