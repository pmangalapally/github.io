As an entry-level individual contributor at Cognizant, I implemented new applications, enhanced and supported one of the HealthCare payers' member enrollment and eligibility applications developed using C#, Sybase, UNIX, Crystal Reports, and Trizetto's Facets product. Performed gap analysis and remediation steps for upgrading Enterprises Core Administration processing from Facets 4.21 version to 4.61 version as well as unifying multiple markets applications Information Solutions applications.  

Gained knowledge about the USA Healthcare system and Enterprise standard processes and procedures in applications' implementations, enhancements, and bug fixes under a successful mentorship program.  

Applications unification was an optimized solution for the customer to onboard new health plans and maintain existing health plans.
